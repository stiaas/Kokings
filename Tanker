__--Connectors--__

I have now decided to use som panelmounted RJ45 connectors for the temperature sensors.
This is because it's the stirdiest connector/price combination i have found yet.


--mControllers--
I'm using several (three so far) Arduinos as controllers. I use several because it's hard to keep control over all the pins
if i use only one, really not shure if there is enough pins on one arduino to handle my project anyways.

The Arduinos has to talk to eachother since the values from sensors and such has to be shared between several arduinos.

--Opticals--
There are several values that need to be displayed in my project:
*temp at Coloumn product outtake
*temp at Coloumn middle
*temp at Boiler
*temp at Water cooling outlet
mabee a timer, so i can reliably se how mutch time has passed.
Timer for equlibrium, (starts at 78'C, and counts town 45mins) really nice to have, so i can monitor the progress.

Warning diodes for:
Hi temp cooling RED
Hi/low temp product outtake RED/YELLOW

Status diodes for:
self check RED/GREEN

--Sensors--
So far i need 4 Temperature-sensors, these will be placed:
*Coloumn product outtake
*Coloumn middle
*Boiler
*Water cooling outlet

Sensors to be added later:
Temp sensor at the top of the coloumn, as a safety measure.
Flow sensor on cooling water, to work out how mutch water i use.
Fluid sensor in product collector, to work out 4shots and tails

--Others--
Mount a serious warning buzzer, this need to be LOUD! and will activate is coloumn top 
or water cooling temp gets to high.
Motor for opening/closeing the product outtake
Servo for switching product collectors
A small buzzer for information pruposes, middle coloumn starts go heat up and such
